# Homebrain Change Log

Operational/administrative changes to the homebrain setup. (Architecture and feature
design live in the per-topic docs; this log is for discrete operational changes.)

## 2026-06-28 — Home Assistant user "Vio" created (standard / non-admin)

- Created a new Home Assistant user **Vio** via the HA UI (owner action).
- Type: **Standard user (non-administrator)**; login **enabled**.
- **No** long-lived access tokens created.
- **No** changes to existing users, groups, dashboards, automations, or integrations.
- **No** additional entities or scripts exposed to ChatGPT.
- Home Assistant was **not** restarted.
- An initial password was set during creation. The password is **not stored in this
  repository** (or anywhere in the repo); change/rotate it via the HA UI as needed.
- Verify: Settings → People → Users → "Vio" shows **no Administrator badge**.
